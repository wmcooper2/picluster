# Pi cluster controls

### Purpose

Control a small cluster of raspberry pi nodes remotely from my macbook.

### Operation

#### Simple, routine controls
* For routine commands use the "simple.py" module
* From the command line, run `python3 simple.py -h` for help.
* Node wlan0 ip addresses are kept in a separate module 
  * to keep my personal info off of github

#### Custom controls, (sudo level, be careful)
* For sending custom commands not routine, use the "custom.py" module
  * unfinished

### To do
* give a timeout to the commands
* Tests need more thought.
